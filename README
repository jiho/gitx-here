DESCRIPTION:

GitX Here is an AppleScript app which makes opening GitX from the Finder easy.

It is intended to live in the Finder's toolbar

When the icon is clicked, GitX opens the folder currently displayed in the frontmost Finder window.
When a file or folder is dropped on the icon, the parent git repository is opened in GitX (which is possibly the dropper folder itself).

Pressing Option (⌥) or Command (⌘) while clicking or dropping items opens GitX in commit mode

It is based on the OpenTerminalHere version described there:
